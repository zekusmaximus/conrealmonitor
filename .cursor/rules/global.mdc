When building these experiences, people will refer to the "devvit app" ([/src/devvit](mdc:src/devvit)) and "client" ([/src/client](mdc:src/client)).

Folders to code in:

- [/src/client](mdc:src/client): This is the full screen webview. To persist data and access the server, call `fetch(/my/api/endpoint)`. This is how you get access to the APIs you write in [/src/server](mdc:src/server).
- [/src/server](mdc:src/server): This is a serverless backend written in Node. This is where you can access redis and save data.
- [/src/shared](mdc:src/shared): This is where you can place code that is to be shared between the devvit app, client, and server and the webview. It's a great place for shared types.

Rules:

- Assume that typescript, vite, tailwind, eslint, prettier, and all codebase configuration is working. If there is a bug, it is more likely your code than the codebase configuration.
- Prefer type aliases over interfaces when writing typescript
