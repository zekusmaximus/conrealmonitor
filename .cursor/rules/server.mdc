Guidelines:

- This is a serverless node.js environment, you have all node globals at your disposal except: fs, http, https, and net.

- Instead of http or https, prefer fetch
- You cannot write files as you are running on a read only file system
- Do not install any libraries that rely on these to function
- Websockets are not supported
- HTTP streaming is not supported
- Redis is accessible from `import { redis } from '@devvit/web/server'`

As this is a serverless runtime (akin to AWS Lambda), do not try to run SQLite or stateful in memory processes. For realtime use cases, consult the docs with devvit_search to learn more about the realtime service you can use.
